<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    The <em>Rayleigh Correction</em> processing is organised in several steps. First the Rayleigh
    reflectance is computed for every 4x4 pixels window. Then, Rayleigh transmittance and Rayleigh
    spherical albedo are computed for every 4x4 pixels window. Then, the TOA apparent reflectance
    corrected for gaseous absorption &#961;<sub>ng</sub> is corrected for Rayleigh contributions for each pixel in order
    to
    derive the top of aerosol reflectance r<sub>top</sub>. The 4x4 pixels windows do not overlap.
